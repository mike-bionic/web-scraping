# web-scraping using Python and BeautifulSoup4 library
Here I tried to get data from webpages that could be used for training the AI.
BS4 gives the ability to scrap the webpage contents and get the needed information.

## current examples are:
> Get news from the Turkmenportal (news agency) website [can be used for both english and turkmen languages, just need to change the url]
-------------------------------------
> Get the current weather information from one of sinoptics webpage
